And like all systems, they work best when their components are aligned and working smoothly together.For many businesses, organic growth, opportunistic client wins and the necessary focus on clients often creates a structure of convenience rather than one optimised for effective delivery. It’s important then, to review this structure objectively and decide if it’s fit for purpose or in need of change.So, when developing your organisation&#x27;s structure, ask yourself these seven questions:1. Does this help me achieve my vision? Referring back to your business vision and mission statement regularly will allow you stay consistent with the changes you want to make. It’ll also help to assure you that you’re heading in the right direction.2. What’s best for the business? A useful exercise is to review your structure around what the business needs rather than who&#x27;s in it.3. Does this align with the culture and values of the business? Sometimes change just needs to happen. However, getting people on board with changes is easier if they see that developments are consistent with what the business stands for.4. What do our clients want? Take time to understand how your clients buy from you and what their journey through your business involves for them. This will help you develop closer relations with clients and provide for their current and future needs.5. What type of service do I want to deliver? Build your organisational structure around the type of service you’re planning to deliver. If you deliver multiple services, think about how you can structure them to work smoothly together.6. Is my structure helping me deliver more profitability? Make sure your structure allows you to deliver your services efficiently, with the right level of resourcing to maintain good margins.7. Would I be able to scale the business quickly? If you win a new client or develop a new service offering, your structure will need to allow for rapid growth. It will also need to be resilient enough to stand up under pressure.Any changes you make need to fit with your existing business systems. Alternatively, you can modify your systems, such as HR processes, to accommodate the changes.Plan change carefully to minimise disruption. By going through a systematic process, the logic behind the changes will be clearer. This will also make it easier for you to move to your new structure while keeping up with the day-to-day running of the business.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title fx-2" data-reactid="27"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="28"><h1 data-reactid="29"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="30"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="31">Maximise the value of your business Part 1 – Business value: what it is and how it’s determined</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 32 --><!-- react-empty: 33 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text fx-1" data-reactid="34"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="35"><p data-reactid="36">Why are some companies are more valuable than others when they all have access to the same talent, resources, clients and knowledge?It’s a big question, so we’re going to tackle it in an eight-part blog series. Over the next few weeks, we’ll look at exactly value is, what drives it - and how you can maximise it.Would you buy your business?To focus your mind on the value of your business, imagine for a moment that you want to sell it and put yourself in your potential buyers’ shoes. To you, your business is the sum total of your hard work and dedication. It probably represents many a late night, some big personal sacrifices and no small amount of risk.Very little of which will be of interest to your hardheaded business buyers. What they’re looking for are real commercial assets with clear profit potential.V = P x MWhen it comes to putting a figure on the value a business – especially agencies - the most commonly used formula is:value = profit x multipleProfit is your business’s historic financial performance. The multiple is its future earning potential.Typically, most business owners see increased sales and improved margins as the way to raise the value of their companies. They’re focusing on the profit side of the equation.However, when we work with clients who are looking to sell a business (and by definition maximise its value), we focus more on the multiple side of the equation. As you’ll discover throughout this blog series, driving the multiple is a far more effective way to increase business value.TimingTiming is also a factor in determining the value of your business. If you’re looking at your business in terms of its eventual sale value, you’ll want to dispose of it at the peak of its profit/multiple potential. Selling too early could mean selling yourself short. Leave it too late, on the other hand, and you may find yourself working through an earnout structure when you’d rather be doing something else.External factors could also influence the value of your business at any given time. Market forces, exchange rates, pending government legislation and even weather conditions can affect your profits depending on the products or services your business provides.A formal strategy that primes your business for optimum growth at the right moment will help you get this balance right. Vision, purpose, risk, market intelligence, value drivers and, of course, your own personal goals are all factored into this strategy along with an action plan to make things happen.In Part 2 of this series, we’ll look at the importance of your business’s vision and the benefits of a clear plan that all your stakeholders can buy into.In the meantime, to talk about growing your business, call me,
