title: 7 questions to ask when developing your organisational structure
publisher: {}
description: >-
  Businesses are dynamic systems. And like all systems, they work best when
  their components are aligned and working smoothly together.  For many
  businesses, organic growth, opportunistic client wins and the necessary focus
  on clients often creates a structure of convenience rather than one optimised
  for effective delivery. It’s important then, to review this structure
  objectively and decide if it’s fit for purpose or in need of change.  So, when
  developing your organisation's structure, ask yourself these seven questions: 
  1. Does this help me achieve my vision? Referring back to your business vision
  and mission statement regularly will allow you stay consistent with the
  changes you want to make. It’ll also help to assure you that you’re heading in
  the right direction.  2. What’s best for the business? A useful exercise is to
  review your structure around what the business needs rather than who's in it. 
  3. Does this align with the culture and values of the business? Sometimes
  change just needs to happen. However, getting people on board with changes is
  easier if they see that developments are consistent with what the business
  stands for.  4. What do our clients want? Take time to understand how your
  clients buy from you and what their journey through your business involves for
  them. This will help you develop closer relations with clients and provide for
  their current and future needs.  5. What type of service do I want to deliver?
  Build your organisational structure around the type of service you’re planning
  to deliver. If you deliver multiple services, think about how you can
  structure them to work smoothly together. 6. Is my structure helping me
  deliver more profitability? Make sure your structure allows you to deliver
  your services efficiently, with the right level of resourcing to maintain good
  margins.  7. Would I be able to scale the business quickly? If you win a new
  client or develop a new service offering, your structure will need to allow
  for rapid growth. It will also need to be resilient enough to stand up under
  pressure.  Any changes you make need to fit with your existing business
  systems. Alternatively, you can modify your systems, such as HR processes, to
  accommodate the changes.  Plan change carefully to minimise disruption. By
  going through a systematic process, the logic behind the changes will be
  clearer. This will also make it easier for you to move to your new structure
  while keeping up with the day-to-day running of the business.

# 7 questions to ask when developing your organisational structure

Businesses are dynamic systems. And like all systems, they work best when their components are aligned and working smoothly together.  
For many businesses, organic growth, opportunistic client wins and the necessary focus on clients often creates a structure of convenience rather than one optimised for effective delivery. It's important then, to review this structure objectively and decide if it's fit for purpose or in need of change.  
So, when developing your organisation's structure, ask yourself these seven questions:
