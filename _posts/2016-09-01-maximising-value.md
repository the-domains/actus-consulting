# Maximising value
![You've put the effor in. Now get the rewards out. ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/419b47c3-c1e6-4900-9608-c9e5bcdaa67c.jpg)

Whether you sell or keep your business, we'll help you make sure it has real market value.  
  
Because we know what buyers look for in a business acquisition, we know exactly where to focus on building value. So, we will:

* examine all areas of your business

* build a plan to maximise its value

* make valuation-based recommendations to improve the multiple your business can achieve

* build an action plan for corporate development

* optimise your business based on what buyers/investors value

* provide a macro view of your market and highlight factors driving transactional value

The result? Improved profits if you keep your business, the best possible multiple if you sell.
